CI is a **good** civic engagement organisation devoted to social research and the development of [open goverment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_government) tools to improve the exercise of governance towards a better democracy. They have released upstanding apps like [Elegilegi](http://www.elegilegi.org/) and 
[Decada Votada](http://www.decadavotada.com.ar/), drawing attention of [local](http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1604004-como-votarias-siendo-diputado) and 
[international](https://source.opennews.org/en-US/articles/decada-votada-news-app-track-voting-records/) news.

Since I was a teenager I dream of being part of a open goverment initiative and I think this is a great opportunity for me to add up to a team effort 
towards the envision and effective implementation of an open democracy in Argentina.

M-x start-hacking.
