During the past weeks, I started to question myself about one of my current endeavors: [Psychlopedia](http://psiclopedia.svankmajer.net/).
I want to get a thorough comprehension of what I am trying to accomplish with the time and resources I am putting into this project. Know 
what can be done, thus find out and test what could or should be done to finally **do** what must be done.

No fooling around.

I want to make clear that I don't know for certain any of what I will be talking about in this post. This is an exploratory exercise to me, and it
should be so for you too, so please bear that in mind.

I was reading [thoughtbot](http://thoughtbot.com/)'s [Playbook](http://playbook.thoughtbot.com/) when I stumbled on Product Design Sprints, an amazing 
concept developed by the [Google Ventures' design team](http://www.gv.com/design/). 
Essentially, a Product Design Sprint is a technique that increases the chance of channeling efforts into meaningful and sustainable productions. 
Please read thoughtbot's [amazing article](http://robots.thoughtbot.com/the-product-design-sprint) on this subject which explains it to the detail 
perfectly.

Currently I am stressing the following question: ['what job is the user hiring the product to do?'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f84LymEs67Y).
It is a question proposed by [Clayton Christensen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clayton_M._Christensen), a Business Administration professor at
Harvard Business School. Having asked myself about this not even once in my own product design path, I was really intrigued. So I grabbed my coat
and went out for a random walk (*on a Hidden Markov chain*), my regular deep thinking session.

Walking down Colegiales, I started to identify three possible jobs Psychlopedia in its current conception could do and do pretty well:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Feed our curiosity and increase the quality of its by-products*.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Connect us to others through our inner experiences*.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Lessen our fear and/or anxiety towards psychonautics*.

So now I am trying to finish the critical path based on these assumptions.

*This is a work-in-progress and part of a series on product design focused on Psychlopedia, a digital archive of psychedelic experiences.*
