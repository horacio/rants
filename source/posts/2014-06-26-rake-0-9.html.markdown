Reading `bbatsov`'s [blog](http://batsov.com/articles/2014/05/30/find-out-where-a-rake-task-is-defined/) (Rubocop creator), I found out about something
cool introduced on Rake 0.9. Take a look at this:

```bash
$ rake -W publish
rake publish  /home/svankmajer/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.1.2@rants/../gh-pages.rake:65:in `<top (required)>'
```

Yeap, `rake -W <task>` resolves to where the task is defined. You can also run it without parameters and see that output for all available tasks. Pretty 
solid.
