      <p>Yesterday at 5pm, Alexander &ldquo;Sasha&rdquo; Shulgin passed away.</p>

<p><code>pmoriarty</code> summarized on Hacker News all my feelings for Shulgin&#39;s inspiring work and legacy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He synthesized and carefully chronicled the effects of hundreds of psychoactive compounds on himself and a small, dedicated core group of explorers of human consciousness.</p>

<p>His efforts were published in two massive, definitive tomes called PiHKAL[3][4] and TiKHAL[5][6], the titles of which stand for &ldquo;Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved&rdquo; and &ldquo;Tryptamines I Have Known and Loved&rdquo;, respectively.</p>

<p>These volumes contained detailed chemical synthesis instructions for the compounds he created, along with &ldquo;trip reports&rdquo; and ratings[7] of the compounds&#39; psychoactivity, ranging from:</p>

<p>PLUS / MINUS (+/-) &ldquo;The level of effectiveness of a drug that indicates a threshold action. If a higher dosage produces a greater response, then the plus/minus (+/-) was valid. If a higher dosage produces nothing, then this was a false positive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>to</p>

<p>PLUS FOUR (++++) &ldquo;A rare and precious transcendental state, which has been called a &#39;peak experience&#39;, a &#39;religious experience,&#39; &#39;divine transformation,&#39; a &#39;state of Samadhi&#39; and many other names in other cultures. It is not connected to the +1, +2, and +3 of the measuring of a drug&#39;s intensity. It is a state of bliss, a participation mystique, a connectedness with both the interior and exterior universes, which has come about after the ingestion of a psychedelic drug, but which is not necessarily repeatable with a subsequent ingestion of that same drug. If a drug (or technique or process) were ever to be discovered which would consistently produce a plus four experience in all human beings, it is conceivable that it would signal the ultimate evolution, and perhaps the end of, the human experiment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His chemistry lab was DEA-licensed to handle &ldquo;illegal&rdquo; (scheduled) compounds, though he often synthesized entirely novel compounds which were not scheduled because neither the compounds nor the laws scheduling them existed yet.</p>

<p>Shulgin tirelessly educated the public and the law-enforcement community on the effects and value of psychedelic and psychoactive compounds, and wrote a highly informative Q&amp;A column.[7]</p>

<p>Shulgin&#39;s pioneering work inspired generations of chemists, self-experimenters, and explorers. He was well known, loved, and respected as one of the most highly accomplished psychedelic chemists in history. His presence and guidance will be deeply missed.</p>
